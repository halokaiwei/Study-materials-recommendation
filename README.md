# Study Materials Recommendation System using machine learning - Python
Libraries used: tensorflow,matplotlib,pandas,numpy,scikit-learn
Technology: Natural Language Processing, Universal Sentence Encoder by tensorflow_hub

The objectives:
  1. To train the model by using the data from collected user feedbacks from Lightbot application
  2. To develop a prediction model to predict user's preferred learning tool by using user's preferred learning mode
  3. To develop a recommendation model which by embedding input into vector representations and cosine_similarity to find the most suitable study materials
  4. To deploy the recommendation system to Google Cloud Platform to receive http request from Lightbot application
